**Using watch data to avoid lazy days**

I have found my smartwatch useful for measuring my levels of movement and exercise, but I have noticed my activity varies substantially day to day. If I were able to identify and understand which days I tend to move least, it should be fairly straightforward to improve my overall fitness and wellbeing with some simple adjustments.

The aim of this project is to explore my watch data, to reduce the number of days where I move very little.

As I think about how to become more consistent, I will explore two areas:

_a) Are there days/ months I'm consistently moving less?_

_b) Is there any connection between my movement and other data?_

Such as my sleep, stepcount, or the presence or absence of a dedicated workout.

From this I hope to reach conclusions on what modest adjustments I can make to eradicate these low activity days.
